  "title": "Chemical Composition and Polyphenolic Compounds of Red Wines: Their Antioxidant Activities and Effects on Human Healthâ€”A Review",
  "Abstract": "Red wine, an alcoholic beverage is composed of a spectrum of complex compounds such as water, alcohol, glycerol, organic acid, carbohydrates, polyphenols, and minerals as well as volatile compounds. Major factors that affect the levels of phenolic compounds in red wines are the variety of grapes and the storage of the wines. Among the constituents of red wine, phenolic compounds play a crucial role in attributes including color and mouthfeel and confer beneficial properties on health. Most importantly, phenolic compounds such as flavanols, flavonols, flavanones, flavones, tannins, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and resveratrol can prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, inflammation, and some other chronic diseases.",
  "Disease_List": [
    "cardiovascular diseases",
    "cancers",
    "diabetes",
    "inflammation"
  ],
  "Reason": "The abstract explicitly mentions specific disease names such as 'cardiovascular diseases', 'cancers', 'diabetes', and 'inflammation'. These are clearly identified as diseases or health conditions that phenolic compounds in red wine can help prevent, thus justifying a 'Y' classification.",
