  "title": "Indoor Air Pollution and Reactive Nitrogen: A Serious Health Issue",
  "Abstract": "Recently, it has been realized that increasing air pollution at work places as well as in the ambient air has serious health hazards. Air pollutants such as CO, SO2, NOx, dust, toxic vapours, volatile organics, carbon soot and heavy metals have significant impact on human health. Inhalation and accumulation of toxic substances impact children and women significantly.1 Indoor air pollution is generated by outdoor sources as well as indoor sources. Indoor sources include fuel burning, carpet, furniture, household products, paints etc. Building materials, furnishings, paints etc. may have low viscosity or high porosity which enables diffusion of the molecules into them. Consequently, species which are volatile in the outdoor atmosphere behave as semi-volatile compounds indoors and their concentrations are higher on the surface because of partitioning to these static surfaces as compared to their gaseous forms, thereby, uniquely changing the indoor chemistry.2-3 Around 4 million people die prematurely due to household air pollution mainly contributed by polluting cook stoves biomass and kerosene.4 Indoor air pollution results in noncommunicable diseases such as stroke, ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) etc.",
