  "title": "Long-term ambient hydrocarbons exposure and incidence of ischemic stroke",
  "Abstract": "Exposure to air pollutants is known to have adverse effects on human health; however, little is known about the association between hydrocarbons in air and an ischemic stroke (IS) event. We investigated whether long-term exposure to airborne hydrocarbons, including volatile organic compounds, increased IS risk. This retrospective cohort study included 283,666 people aged 40 years or older in Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to fit single- and multiple-pollutant models for two targeted pollutants, total hydrocarbons (THC) and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and estimated the risk of IS. Before controlling for multiple pollutants, hazard ratios (HRs) of IS with 95% confidence intervals for the overall population were 2.69 (2.64–2.74) at 0.16-ppm increase in THC and 1.62 (1.59–1.66) at 0.11-ppm increase in NMHC. For the multiple-pollutant models controlling for PM2.5, the adjusted HR was 3.64 (3.56–3.72) for THC and 2.21 (2.16–2.26) for NMHC. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to THC and NMHC may be a risk factor for IS development.",
