  "title": "Noninvasive Diabetes Detection through Human Breath Using TinyML-Powered E-Nose",
  "Abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled human breath serve as pivotal biomarkers for disease identification and medical diagnostics. In the context of diabetes mellitus, the noninvasive detection of acetone, a primary biomarker using electronic noses (e-noses), has gained significant attention. However, employing e-noses requires pre-trained algorithms for precise diabetes detection, often requiring a computer with a programming environment to classify newly acquired data. This study focuses on the development of an embedded system integrating Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and an e-nose equipped with Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors for real-time diabetes detection. The study encompassed 44 individuals, comprising 22 healthy individuals and 22 diagnosed with various types of diabetes mellitus. Test results highlight the XGBoost Machine Learning algorithmâ€™s achievement of 95% detection accuracy. Additionally, the integration of deep learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), yielded a detection efficacy of 94.44%. These outcomes underscore the potency of combining e-noses with TinyML in embedded systems, offering a noninvasive approach for diabetes mellitus detection.",
