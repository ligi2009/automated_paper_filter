  "title": "Environmental and Health Impacts of Crude Oil Exploration in the Niger Delta",
  "Abstract": "Purpose: This research aims to assess the environmental and health consequences of crude oil exploration in the Niger Delta, focusing on the emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants and their impacts on public health.\nMethodology: Literature search was done independently by the authors. After searching for articles on the identified databases, other sources of available and useful data on the subject such as the print press, studentâ€™s thesis and dissertation among others were sourced by hand search to augmented resources from the electronic databases.The Literature search was based on the careful evaluation of key words in the title and abstract of identified studies.\nFindings: The synthesis of available literature revealed significant insights into the environmental and health repercussions of crude oil exploration in the Niger Delta. The impact of gas flaring emerged as a major concern, leading to the release of pollutants like carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile organic compounds. These emissions contribute to elevated atmospheric temperatures, greenhouse gas concentrations, and the formation of acid rain, exacerbating global warming and disease transmission. The exposed population experiences a range of health problems including chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular abnormalities, altered blood parameters, and an increased risk of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Prolonged exposure to pollutants from oil exploration is linked to disrupted sleep patterns, elevated stress levels, and neurophysiological disturbances, further contributing to adverse health outcomes.\nUnique contribution to theory, practice, and policy: This study advances existing knowledge by providing a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted interplay between crude oil exploration, environmental degradation, and human health in the Niger Delta region. The research offers a substantial contribution to theoretical understanding by illuminating the intricate relationship between anthropogenic activities, environmental factors, and health outcomes. Moreover, the study provides practical implications by proposing a series of recommendations aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of oil exploration. These recommendations advocate for stricter regulations on emissions, increased monitoring and enforcement, adoption of cleaner technologies, community engagement, and investment in healthcare and environmental remediation. The findings inform policy formulation by supplying evidence-based insights to develop robust regulations and interventions that promote sustainable development, protect public health, and safeguard the environment for future generations.",
