  "title": "Impact of Sawmill Industry on Ambient Air Quality: A Case Study of Ilorin Metropolis, Kwara State, Nigeria",
  "Abstract": "Amid sawmill busy lives, air pollution is one of the greatest casualties of our time and has increased worldwide since 1990. Today, the history of air pollution in sawmills accounts for 93.32% of the total number of wood processing industries in Nigeria, it seems daunting, overwhelming and have positioned the country at a perilous crossroad. For emerging nations such as Nigeria with a population projected to hit 410.6 million humans by 2050 with up to 40-60 million people with mental disorders at the moment, consequently more than 40,000 deaths a year will be due to air pollution. 7 million deaths worldwide is attributed to air pollution with the number set to increase significantly in coming decades mostly through non-communicable diseases like lung cancer, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but also through acute respiratory infections like pneumonia. Similarly, around 90% of all people breathe air contaminated with pollutants. In 2015, tobacco caused 7 million deaths, 1.2 million AIDS, 1.1 million cases of tuberculosis and 0.7 million of malaria, 19% of all cardiovascular deaths, 24% of all deaths due to ischaemic heart disease. 21% of stroke deaths, and 23% of deaths from lung cancer. Non-communicable diseases are responsible for 70% of deaths from air pollution and are a major cause of unexplained infections. In addition, air pollution seems to be significant but it is still not a determinant factor of the risk of neurodegenerative disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. This study assessed ambient air quality in major sawmill sites in Ilorin Metropolis, Kwara State, Nigeria. Air pollution measurements were made using direct reading through automatic in situ gas monitors; Hand held mobile multi-gas monitor with model AS8900 (Combustible (LEL), and Oxygen (O2)), BLATN with model BRâ€”Smart Series air quality monitor (PM10, Formaldehyde) and air quality multimeter with model B SIDE EET100 (Dust (PM2.5), VOC, Temperature and Relative Humidity). The results show that the mean concentrations of CO, O2 and other measured parameters such as Formaldehyde (HcHo) etc., are commonly lower and within acceptable range of National and International regulatory standards for air quality indices. There are however some exceptions such as mean concentrations of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), PM2.5, PM10 and Combustible (LEL) respectively high when compared to National and International standards. This high value is attributed to the amount of pollutant present in the sawmills due to the input of influents it receives from activities of the sawmill. This is why there has been air pollution in Ilorin metropolis and were however, found to be polluted. Given the high cost of additional measures to lessen air pollution and the new perspectives suggesting that health effects can be observed at low concentrations, the health effects of air pollution should be of scientific and regulatory interest in coming years. In the absence of aggressive control, ambient air pollution is expected to cause between 6 and 9 million deaths a year by 2060.",

However, it does not specifically link Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentrations to ischaemic heart disease. The measured CO levels in the study were generally within acceptable regulatory limits, and no direct evidence or data in the abstract connects CO exposure to ischaemic heart disease risk. Therefore, based on this abstract alone, there is no clear relationship established between Carbon Monoxide (CO) and ischaemic heart disease."

It specifically mentions that 23% of deaths from lung cancer are attributed to air pollution. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are identified as one of the pollutants present at high concentrations in the sawmill sites studied, exceeding national and international standards. Given that VOCs are a component of air pollution and that air pollution is linked to lung cancer mortality, there is evidence of a relationship between VOC exposure and lung cancer risk."

Since VOCs are a component of air pollution and air pollution is linked to stroke mortality, there is evidence of a relationship between VOC exposure and stroke risk as presented in the abstract."

It highlights that Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) levels were found to be high in sawmill areas, exceeding national and international air quality standards. Since VOCs are a component of air pollution and air pollution is linked to COPD in the abstract, there is evidence of a relationship between VOCs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

It specifically mentions that air pollution, which includes pollutants like Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), is linked to acute respiratory infections like pneumonia. Furthermore, the study highlights elevated levels of VOCs in sawmill areas, indicating exposure to these compounds. Therefore, there is evidence in the abstract that VOCs, as part of air pollution, have a relationship with pneumonia."

It also references various diseases and causes of death related to air pollution, including non-communicable diseases and acute respiratory infections.

The mention of tuberculosis is in the context of tobacco-related deaths, not VOC exposure.

It also references mortality statistics related to air pollution and tobacco, including deaths from malaria. However, the mention of malaria is in the context of deaths caused by tobacco use, not VOC exposure or air pollution directly. There is no evidence or discussion in the abstract linking VOCs specifically to malaria or indicating that VOCs influence malaria risk or incidence.

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are identified in the study as one of the pollutants with concentrations higher than national and international standards in sawmill areas, indicating significant exposure. Although the abstract does not explicitly link VOCs alone to IHD, it groups VOCs among the air pollutants contributing to overall air pollution, which is associated with increased IHD mortality. Therefore, there is evidence of a relationship between VOCs (as part of air pollution) and ischaemic heart disease."
