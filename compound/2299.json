  "Abstract": "Nowadayâ€™s air pollution is increasing because of harmful material in earth atmosphere causing deceases, deaths, and damage to crop. These harmful material can be natural origin or man-made. The main source of these harmful materials is power plant and manufacturing factories. The main air pollutant which can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem, are sulphur oxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compound, chlorofluorocarbons ammonia and toxic metals. These air pollutants can have adverse effect on human health like headache, fatigue, poor memory, respiratory irritation, pneumonia in children, lung cancer, heart disease, eye, and nose and throat irritation.",
