  "title": "Breath Fingerprint of Colorectal Cancer Patients Based on the Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Analysis",
  "Abstract": "The human body emits a multitude of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via tissues and various bodily fluids or exhaled breath. These compounds collectively create a distinctive chemical profile, which can potentially be employed to identify changes in human metabolism associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and, consequently, facilitate the diagnosis of this disease. The main goal of this study was to investigate and characterize the VOCs’ chemical patterns associated with the breath of CRC patients and controls and identify potential expiratory markers of this disease. For this purpose, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was applied. Collectively, 1656 distinct compounds were identified in the breath samples provided by 152 subjects. Twenty-two statistically significant VOCs (p-xylene; hexanal; 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane; 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate; hexadecane; nonane; ethylbenzene; cyclohexanone; diethyl phthalate; 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one; 2-butanone; benzaldehyde; dodecanal; benzothiazole; tetradecane; 1-dodecanol; 1-benzene; 3-methylcyclopentyl acetate; 1-nonene; toluene) were observed at higher concentrations in the exhaled breath of the CRC group. The elevated levels of these VOCs in CRC patients’ breath suggest the potential for these compounds to serve as biomarkers for CRC.",
