  "title": "Improving the Quality of the Air and Implementing into Effective Pollution Mitigation Methods",
  "Abstract": "This review paper explores the impact of air pollution on human health, focusing on indoor and outdoor air quality. It highlights the importance of pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to diseases like lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. The paper also examines sources and types of air pollutants, including industrial activities, transportation, and natural events. It presents a comparative analysis of air quality issues across different regions, highlighting the complexities and severity of pollution. The paper examines pollution control technologies for industry and transport, innovative approaches like hydrogen fuel utilization and intelligent transportation systems. It also discusses the influence of regulatory standards on indoor environmental quality and the challenges posed by regional differences. The paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on air quality management and encourages the development of more robust pollution control measures.",
