  "title": "Using Volatile Organic Compounds to Investigate the Effect of Oral Iron Supplementation on the Human Intestinal Metabolome",
  "Abstract": "Patients with iron deficiency anaemia are treated with oral iron supplementation, which is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects by likely interacting with the gut microbiome. To better study this impact on the microbiome, we investigated oral iron-driven changes in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the faecal metabolome. Stool samples from patients with iron deficiency anaemia were collected pre- and post-treatment (n = 45 and 32, respectively). Faecal headspace gas analysis was performed by gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry and the changes in VOCs determined. We found that the abundance of short-chain fatty acids and esters fell, while aldehydes increased, after treatment. These changes in pre- vs. post-iron VOCs resemble those reported when the gut is inflamed. Our study shows that iron changes the intestinal metabolome, we suggest by altering the structure of the gut microbial community.",

It reports that after treatment, the levels of aldehydes in the faecal metabolome increased. This indicates a relationship between aldehydes and iron deficiency anaemia in the context of treatment, as the disease state and its management are associated with changes in aldehyde levels. The increase in aldehydes is linked to alterations in the gut microbiome and intestinal metabolome caused by iron supplementation in these patients."
