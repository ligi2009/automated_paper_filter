  "title": "Detection of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease through breath biomarkers",
  "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Novel sensors were developed to detect exhaled volatile organic compounds to aid in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment associated with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sensors were sensitive to a rat model that combined the human apolipoprotein E (APOE)4 gene with aging and the Western diet. Methods Gas sensors fabricated from molecularly imprinted polymer‐graphene were engineered to react with alkanes and small fatty acids associated with lipid peroxidation. With a detection sensitivity in parts per trillion the sensors were tested against the breath of wild‐type and APOE4 male rats. Resting state BOLD functional connectivity was used to assess hippocampal function. Results Only APOE4 rats, and not wild‐type controls, tested positive to several small hydrocarbons and presented with reduced functional coupling in hippocampal circuitry. Discussion These results are proof‐of‐concept toward the development of sensors that can be used as breath detectors in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of presymptomatic AD.",

The sensors detected several small hydrocarbons, including alkanes, specifically in APOE4 rats that also showed reduced hippocampal functional connectivity, a feature related to Alzheimer's pathology. This indicates a relationship between alkanes and Alzheimer's disease, as the presence of alkanes in exhaled breath correlates with early-stage AD markers in this model."

These small fatty acids are associated with lipid peroxidation, a process linked to oxidative stress in AD. The sensors detected these compounds specifically in APOE4 rats, which also showed reduced hippocampal functional connectivity, a hallmark of early AD pathology. This indicates a relationship between small fatty acids and Alzheimer's disease, as their presence correlates with disease-associated changes in this model."
