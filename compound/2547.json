  "title": "Diagnostic Application of Volatile Organic Compounds as Potential Biomarkers for Detecting Digestive Neoplasia: A Systematic Review",
  "Abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are part of the exhaled breath that were proposed as non-invasive breath biomarkers via different human discharge products like saliva, breath, urine, blood, or tissues. Particularly, due to the non-invasive approach, VOCs were considered as potential biomarkers for non-invasive early cancer detection. We herein aimed to review the data over VOCs utility in digestive neoplasia as early diagnosis or monitoring biomarkers. A systematic literature search was done using MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Thomson Reutersâ€™ Web of Science Core Collection. We identified sixteen articles that were included in the final analysis. Based on the current knowledge, we cannot identify a single VOC as a specific non-invasive biomarker for digestive neoplasia. Several combinations of up to twelve VOCs seem promising for accurately detecting some neoplasia types. A combination of different VOCs breath expression are promising tools for digestive neoplasia screening.",

  "Reason": "The abstract explicitly mentions 'digestive neoplasia' and 'cancer' as specific disease names. Although 'cancer' is a broad term, it is a specific disease category, and 'digestive neoplasia' refers to tumors in the digestive system, which are specific disease conditions. Therefore, the classification is Y.",
