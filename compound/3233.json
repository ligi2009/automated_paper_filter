  "title": "The microbiome in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: associations and implications",
  "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly significant public health problem as the risk factors for NAFLD such as obesity, insulin resistance and type II diabetes have also become more prevalent [1]. The composition of the intestinal microbiota (IM) has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity in clinical and animal studies, suggesting that obese humans exhibit a reduction in microbial diversity coupled with an increase in the ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to lean humans [2,3]. Colonic bacteria may also have effects on the human host through intestinal absorption and delivery to the liver via the portal vein [4]. Therefore two recent papers examining the potential role of IM in NAFLD, by Mouzaki et al [5] and Raman et al [6] respectively, are both timely and relevant. \n \nIn the first of these, Mouzaki et al performed a prospective, cross-sectional study to determine whether differences in IM composition could contribute to the development of NAFLD [5]. Fifty total subjects constituted three groups of varying \n \nNAFLD disease progression: 11 simple steatosis (SS), 22 nonalcoholic steatoheaptitis (NASH), and 17 living liver donors as healthy controls (HC). Subjects in the SS group represent the mildest form of NAFLD, while the NASH group represents the most severe form and can lead to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy confirmed NASH, SS, or healthy liver in controls, and subjects in the NAFLD spectrum underwent extensive assessment to rule out other liver diseases. All subjects completed 7-day food and activity records, and provided stool samples for analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction measured microbial levels in stool samples from each subject. Levels of Bacteroides/Precotella (Bacteriodetes), Clostridium leptum, C. coccoides, bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, total bacteria and Archaea were determined. Subjects in the NASH group had a lower ratio of Bacteriodetes to total bacterial counts in comparison to the SS or HC groups (P=0.006) and higher C. coccoides compared to the SS group (P=0.04). Interestingly, the authors were only able to detect Archaea in five HC, two SS and two NASH subjects, which limited the statistical power for any comparisons. After accounting for BMI and fat intake, no statistical difference remained in C. coccoides levels between groups, but there was still an independent significant association between subjects with NASH and a lower relative abundance of Bacteriodetes. \n \nThe authors concluded that these data provide evidence that the composition of the IM may play a role in the development of NAFLD. As microbes have established inflammatory roles, the authors also proposed that future studies may further elucidate the effects of the IM on the liver and the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of SS and NASH [5]. \n \nIn the second study, Raman et al performed an observational case-control study that investigated the colonic microbiome and other volatile organic compounds (VOC) in obese NAFLD patients and healthy controls [6]. Thirty obese NAFLD subjects and thirty healthy controls participated in the study. Neither group was subject to dietary restrictions, and the obese NAFLD participants had not undertaken any lifestyle modifications [6]. All provided stool samples for characterization of IM by multitag pyrosequencing and of VOC profiles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In contrast to the results of Mouzaki et al [5], no discernable differences were found between the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in obese NAFLD subjects vs. healthy controls. The researchers also did not find a correlation between BMI and the proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes as previously described by Ley et al [7], although the authors did note that the subjects in their study mainly had class I obesity, whereas the subjects in Ley et al had class III and class IV obesity. The authors did find small but significant differences between obese NAFLD patients and controls at the family and genus levels, including an over-representation of Lactobacillus and selected members of phylum Firmicutes in NAFLD subjects, while members of Ruminococcaceae (genus: Oscillibacter) were significantly under-represented. However, it is possible that these differences were due to obesity rather than NAFLD, as the controls were not obese. The authors concluded that there is a shift in the fecal microbiome and a significantly altered fecal VOC profile in obese NAFLD subjects, and propose that, as hepatotropic or hepatotoxic factors, these microbial VOC metabolites may be related to NAFLD [6].",
