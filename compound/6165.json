  "title": "Air pollution exposure and inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic literature review of epidemiological and mechanistic studies",
  "Abstract": "This systematic literature review investigates the relationship between air pollution exposure and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite the growing concern over air pollution's impact on various health outcomes, studies specifically addressing effects on the digestive system, particularly IBD, are relatively rare. This review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on this topic, focusing on the mechanisms underlying these associations and the role of different air pollutants. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search of PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted, yielding 13 epidemiological studies and six mechanistic (toxicological) studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The epidemiological studies examined associations between IBD and various air pollutants, including PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than, or equal to, 2.5 µm), PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than, or equal to, 10 µm), PM2.5–10 (coarse particles with an aerodynamic diameter in the range of 2.5–10 µm), BC (black carbon), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), NO (nitrogen monoxide), NOx (nitrogen oxides), N2O (nitrous oxide), CO (carbon monoxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), VOC (volatile organic compounds), O3 (ozone), Ox (oxidant capacity), and traffic load. Study methodologies varied among these 13 epidemiological studies, including four cohort studies, two ecological studies, three case-control studies, two studies using two-sample Mendelian randomization, and two longitudinal time-series studies. Eight studies investigated associations with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately, while five studies analyzed IBD as a whole without distinguishing between CD and UC. Eleven studies found statistically significant associations between air pollution exposure and IBD, although inconsistent results were found in several of these studies. A total number of six mechanistic (toxicological) studies were retrieved. Among these six studies, five were using particulate matter as exposure metric, and one was based on NO2 and O3 as exposure metrics. With a combination of animal, human, and in vitro studies, the results in terms of biological mechanisms indicate that air pollution exposure influences the composition of the gut microbiome, altering metabolic functions within the gut, and creates immunological reactions with inflammation contributing to the development of IBD. Consequently, the results suggest a link between air pollution exposure and both the onset and exacerbation of IBD. However, differences in study design, exposure assessment, and pollutant types make it challenging to draw any firm conclusions. Moreover, the lack of multi-pollutant models in most epidemiological studies makes it difficult to estimate the individual effect of specific air pollutants. This review highlights the need for further research utilizing robust study designs and standardized exposure assessment methods to better understand the impact of air pollution on IBD. By elucidating these associations, policymakers and healthcare professionals can develop effective strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on digestive health.",

        "reason": "The abstract reports that among various air pollutants studied, including VOC (volatile organic compounds), there are statistically significant associations between air pollution exposure and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the results are somewhat inconsistent and the individual effects of specific pollutants like VOC are difficult to isolate due to lack of multi-pollutant models, the overall evidence from epidemiological and mechanistic studies suggests that air pollution, which includes VOCs, influences gut microbiome composition and immune responses contributing to IBD development and exacerbation. Therefore, there is evidence supporting a relationship between VOC exposure and IBD."

        "relationship": "N",
        "reason": "The abstract reviews multiple studies on air pollution and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD). While VOC (volatile organic compounds) is listed among the air pollutants studied, the abstract does not provide specific evidence or statistically significant associations directly linking VOC exposure to Crohn's disease. Most significant associations were found between air pollution in general and IBD, but results were inconsistent and the lack of multi-pollutant models makes it difficult to isolate the effect of VOC specifically. Therefore, based on the abstract, there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between VOC and Crohn's disease."

Eight studies investigated Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately, and overall, eleven studies found significant associations between air pollution and IBD. Although the results are somewhat inconsistent and the lack of multi-pollutant models complicates isolating the effect of individual pollutants like VOC, the evidence suggests a link between air pollution exposure, including VOC, and the onset and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. The mechanistic studies also support that air pollution influences gut microbiome and immune responses contributing to IBD development.

Specifically, one mechanistic study used NO2 and O3 as exposure metrics and found biological mechanisms indicating that air pollution exposure, including O3, influences gut microbiome composition, metabolic functions, and immunological reactions leading to inflammation contributing to IBD development. Although the results across studies are somewhat inconsistent and it is difficult to isolate the effect of O3 alone due to lack of multi-pollutant models, the evidence suggests a link between O3 exposure and both the onset and exacerbation of IBD. Therefore, there is evidence of a relationship between O3 and inflammatory bowel disease based on the reviewed literature."

Several epidemiological studies found statistically significant associations between air pollution exposure and IBD, and mechanistic studies involving O3 suggest biological mechanisms such as alterations in gut microbiome composition and immunological inflammation that contribute to IBD development.
