  "title": "Xenobiotics Delivered by Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems: Potential Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms on the Pathogenesis of Chronic Kidney Disease",
  "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized as sustained damage to the renal parenchyma, leading to impaired renal functions and gradually progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetes mellitus (DM) and arterial hypertension (AH) are underlying diseases of CKD. Genetic background, lifestyle, and xenobiotic exposures can favor CKD onset and trigger its underlying diseases. Cigarette smoking (CS) is a known modified risk factor for CKD. Compounds from tobacco combustion act through multi-mediated mechanisms that impair renal function. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) consumption, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices, is growing worldwide. ENDS release mainly nicotine, humectants, and flavorings, which generate several byproducts when heated, including volatile organic compounds and ultrafine particles. The toxicity assessment of these products is emerging in human and experimental studies, but data are yet incipient to achieve truthful conclusions about their safety. To build up the knowledge about the effect of currently employed ENDS on the pathogenesis of CKD, cellular and molecular mechanisms of ENDS xenobiotic on DM, AH, and kidney functions were reviewed. Unraveling the toxic mechanisms of action and endpoints of ENDS exposures will contribute to the risk assessment and implementation of proper health and regulatory interventions.",
