  "Abstract": "Statistical Method Based on Confidence and Prediction Regions for Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds in Human Breath Gas In this paper we introduce two confidence and two prediction regions for statistical characterization of concentration measurements of product ions in order to discriminate various groups of persons for prospective better detection of primary lung cancer. Two MATLAB algorithms have been created for more adequate description of concentration measurements of volatile organic compounds in human breath gas for potential detection of primary lung cancer and for evaluation of the appropriate confidence and prediction regions.",
  "Disease_List": [
    "primary lung cancer"
  ],
  "Reason": "The abstract explicitly mentions 'primary lung cancer' as a specific disease name in the context of detecting it through analysis of volatile organic compounds in human breath gas. Therefore, it qualifies as mentioning a specific disease.",
